# JS-Challenge

### Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is for you to demonstrate your ability to create a performant React application that both matches a mock (shown above) in features and functionality. We use this challenge to better understand your coding abilities and determine if you would be a good fit for an in-person interview.

### What we're looking for
- Proficiency in leveraging existing technologies to create a responsive application.
- Ability to use CSS, HTML, and Javascript to match a mock design.
- Logical code architecture and choice of frameworks (within the context of React).
- Comprehensive coverage of use cases.

### Challenge
Create a React app that takes the user input with a form and then displays the results in a table. It should meet the following requirements.
- Clicking the +Add button should open a modal window.
- The form should be filled out and submitted from the modal window.
- Upon submission, the table should update itself without needing to reload the page.
- The form & table should have the following fields:
  - `First Name`
  - `Last Name  `
  - `Date of Birth`
  - `Phone Number`
  - `Address`
  - `Notes`
